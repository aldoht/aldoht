## My name is Aldo and I am a Computer Science Major at UANL

I am an 18-year-old computer science student from Mexico currently focused on learning Full-stack Web Development, but I am open to new technologies as soon as I know about them.

### Web Development Certifications

I am currently taking a certification for Full-Stack Development with React from the University of Helsinki, and all of the work related to it is on my public repository [fullstack-open](https://github.com/aldoht/fullstack-open).

### Web Development Projects

Since my attention is focused on Web Development right now, I am open to practice the most I can doing web projects by myself, you can see some work in progress on My Repositories, for example:
- BisonStore, a finished (without any backend, though) simple project for a class.
- CALISA, a work in progress for the family business (not finished, but planning to resume it later this year).
