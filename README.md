### My name is Aldo and I am a Computer Science Major at UANL

I am currently focused on learning Full-stack Web Development, but I am open to new technologies as soon as I know about them!

## Web Development

Since my attention is focused on Web Development right now, I am open to practice the most I can doing web projects by myself, you can see some work in progress on My Repositories, for example:
- BisonStore, a finished (without any backend, though) simple project for a class.
- CALISA, a work in progress for the family business.
- And more yet to come! c:

## Hobbies

I love spending quality time with my loved ones and playing videogames in my spare time, sometimes I read or colour so I can destress myself. I like to workout at a local gym and also I really like sleeping.

## Contact

If you are interested in contacting me, you can e-mail me at my personal e-mail (linked to this account): aldofernandoht@gmail.com
